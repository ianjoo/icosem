# Call for papers

Theme: **Variations and Dynamics in Iconicity**
 
We invite abstracts of any academic work on **iconicity**, the resemblance between form and meaning, in language or literature. We particularly invite contributions that explore the multifaceted nature of iconicity, encompassing its variations and dynamics across different conceptual domains, languages, cultures, and developmental stages. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
 * Iconicity in the speech signal (sound symbolism, phonaesthemes, ideophones)
 * Iconicity in grammar and text
 * Iconicity in literature
 * Iconicity in sign languages
 * Iconicity in gestures
 * Iconicity in pictures and other visual media
 * Iconicity in music
 * Iconicity in narration
 * Iconicity in imagination (mental imagery)
 * Iconicity across sensory modalities (multimodality and cross-modality)
 * Iconicity in language evolution
 * Iconicity in child development
 * Iconicity among different forms of intelligence (animals, humans, AI, etc.)

Please send a 2-page abstract (including everything) in the following format:

* A4 paper
* 2.5cm margin
* 12pt Times New Roman

Please submit your anonymous abstract via Easychair (available soon). Your abstract will then be reviewed by two anonymous reviewers.

The deadline is **31 August 2025**, but we encourage each participant to **submit as soon as you are ready to**, as decisions will be communicated to you on a rolling basis within two weeks from your submission (and not necessarily after the deadline). This will allow you to plan your trip well in advance.
