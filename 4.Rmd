**IcoLL2026** is the joint conference of the 4th [Iconicity Seminar (IcoSem)](https://ianjoo.github.io/icosem) and the 15th [International Symposium on Iconicity in Language and Literature (ILL)](https://www.iconicity.uzh.ch/en). For the first time, the two international conferences on iconicity will take place together on **21-23 February 2026** hosted by the **Nagoya University Graduate School of Humanities**.

**A Structural Perspective on Relational Similarity in Iconicity**

<details>
  <summary>See abstract</summary>

This presentation explores the potential of a structural approach to account for the motivation behind iconicity. Previous studies on iconicity have identified two major types of similarity: direct (perceptual) similarity and relational similarity (Dingemanse, 2011; Iida & Akita, 2024). Direct similarity refers to similarities between distinct entities based on shared features along specific dimensions (e.g., shape or sound). In contrast, relational similarity involves the structural alignment between the relationships among elements (e.g., shape-shape-relationships and sound-sound relationships). Researchers have noted that cross-modal iconicity must be understood from the perspective of relational similarity (Ahlner & Zlatev, 2011; Marks, 1989). While the psychological basis of relational similarity has been extensively studied, its application to iconicity research remains underdeveloped.　In this context, the present study draws attention to a structural approach, which has recently gained prominence in consciousness research. This approach investigates properties of unobservable phenomena—such as subjective experience—by analyzing the relational structure among surrounding elements, rather than attempting to access the target phenomenon directly (e.g., Kawakita et al., 2024). Using examples of cross-modal iconicity, this presentation examines how structural consistency across modalities can be evaluated, and discusses the implications of this approach for understanding the relational foundations of iconic mappings.

**Iconicity bootstrapping hypothesis for the acquisition and evolution of language**
 
<details>
  <summary>See abstract</summary>
  
This talk refines Imai and Kita's (2014) "sound symbolism bootstrapping hypothesis" that states that iconic sound–meaning associations help children start acquiring spoken language and may also reside in the origin of human language. Iconicity, not limited to sound symbolism, tells children that linguistic forms are paired with meanings, and they expand and adjust their linguistic knowledge through an abductive reasoning. This self-driven developmental cycle may make humans different from other species.

# Call for papers

Theme: **Variations and Dynamics in Iconicity**
 
We invite abstracts of any academic work on **iconicity**, the resemblance between form and meaning, in language or literature. We particularly invite contributions that explore the multifaceted nature of iconicity, encompassing its variations and dynamics across different conceptual domains, languages, cultures, and developmental stages. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
 * Iconicity in the speech signal (sound symbolism, phonaesthemes, ideophones)
 * Iconicity in grammar and text
 * Iconicity in literature
 * Iconicity in sign languages
 * Iconicity in gestures
 * Iconicity in pictures and other visual media
 * Iconicity in music
 * Iconicity in narration
 * Iconicity in imagination (mental imagery)
 * Iconicity across sensory modalities (multimodality and cross-modality)
 * Iconicity in language evolution
 * Iconicity in child development
 * Iconicity among different forms of intelligence (animals, humans, AI, etc.)

Please send a 2-page abstract (including everything) in the following format:

* A4 paper
* 2.5cm margin
* 12pt Times New Roman

Please submit your abstract to Ian Joo at joo@res.otaru-uc.ac.jp. Your abstract will then go through a single-blind review by two anonymous reviewers. As it is a single-blind review, your abstract does not have to be anonymized.

The deadline is **31 August 2025**, but we encourage each participant to **submit as soon as you are ready to**, as decisions will be communicated to you on a rolling basis within two weeks from your submission (and not necessarily after the deadline). This will allow you to plan your trip well in advance.

Each submission will be allocated as either an oral presentation (20min talk + 10min Q&A) or a poster presentation, based on the review and the presenter's preference. Only one abstract submission is permitted per each first author - there is no restriction on the number of abstracts as a non-first author.

After the conference, the presenters will be invited to submit a post-conference proceedings paper to the [Iconicity in Language and Literature](https://benjamins.com/catalog/ill) series (John Benjamins).

# Format of the conference
IcoLL2026 is an in-person conference without virtual participation, although some virtual presentations may be permitted in exceptional cases.

Due to the difficulty of finding an English-to-JSL interpreter with expertise in linguistics and literature, we will unfortunately not be able to provide interpretation in Japanese Sign Language. In order to increase accessibility, however, we will provide live caption in English via Microsoft Teams.

# Participation fee
The participation fee is 8,000 yen for students and 15,000 yen for non-students, to be paid by cash on site.
