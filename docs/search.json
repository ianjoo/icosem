Yet,\nrecent work on expressions in the bodily and graphic modalities have\ncomplicated this view, especially in light of multimodal communication.\nHere, I present a model of a multimodal language faculty which\nintrinsically maintains components for the vocal, bodily, and graphic\nmodalities. This model inherently allows for conventionalization of all\ntypes of signification, including iconicity. I will illustrate this\nfurther by showing the extensive standardized visual lexicons using\nlinguistic structures in purely graphic systems across the world.\nAltogether, this heralds a re-understanding of what language is.\nAccepted papers\n\nTitle\nAuthor\nIconicity through the lens of information\ntheory\nKILPATRICK, Alexander\nProduct names as diagrammatic-iconic\ncompositions\nDÜBBERT, Alexander\nIn sound symbolic effects, visual\ndimensions interact: the case of vowel quality and cuteness\nSCHMITZ, Dominic and CICEK, Defne and\nNGUYEN, Anh Kim and ROTTLEB, Daniel\nWhat ratings and corpus data reveal about\nthe vividness of Mandarin ABB words\nVAN HOEY, Thomas and YU, Xiaoyu and PAN,\nTung-Le and DO, Youngah\nEtymology of imitative words: homonymy\nvs. polysemy\nFLAKSMAN, Maria\nThe iconicity of cross-linguistic\nphonesthetics\nERBEN JOHANSSON, Niklas\n/tʃ/ as a phonestheme in Mexican Spanish:\norigins and phonosemantic fields\nWAGNER OVIEDO, Carlos de Jesús\nVisual-motor iconicity in the spatial\nlanguage of deaf traditional Negev Arabic speakers\nCERQUEGLINI, Letizia\nSound symbolism through the ages: a\nlongitudinal analysis of vowel and tonal patterns in Chinese names\nacross generations\nNGAI, C.
