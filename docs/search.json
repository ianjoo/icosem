Those wishing to present in a sign\nlanguage are welcome do so, in which case English subtitles shall be\nprovided.\nPlenary speaker:\nNeil Cohn (Tilburg University)\nMultimodality, iconcity, and visual\nlexicons\nThe traditional view has held that language is an amodal and\narbitrary system that is mutable across different modalities. Yet,\nrecent work on expressions in the bodily and graphic modalities have\ncomplicated this view, especially in light of multimodal communication.\nHere, I present a model of a multimodal language faculty which\nintrinsically maintains components for the vocal, bodily, and graphic\nmodalities. This model inherently allows for conventionalization of all\ntypes of signification, including iconicity. I will illustrate this\nfurther by showing the extensive standardized visual lexicons using\nlinguistic structures in purely graphic systems across the world.\nAltogether, this heralds a re-understanding of what language is.\nProgram\nEach talk will be 20 minutes presentation and 10 minutes Q&A.\n※ = Presenter\n\nTitle\nAuthor\nTime (GMT)\nWelcome and self-introductions\nJOO, Ian\n07:00\nSound symbolism through the ages: a\nlongitudinal analysis of vowel and tonal patterns in Chinese names\nacross generations\n※NGAI, C.
