Yet, recent work on expressions in the bodily and graphic modalities have complicated this view, especially in light of multimodal communication. Here, I present a model of a multimodal language faculty which intrinsically maintains components for the vocal, bodily, and graphic modalities. This model inherently allows for conventionalization of all types of signification, including iconicity. I will illustrate this further by showing the extensive standardized visual lexicons using linguistic structures in purely graphic systems across the world. Altogether, this heralds a re-understanding of what language is.\nProgram\nEach talk will be 20 minutes presentation and 10 minutes Q&A.\n※ = Presenter\n\nTitle\nAuthor\nTime (GMT)\nWelcome and self-introductions\nJOO, Ian\n07:00\nSound symbolism through the ages: a longitudinal analysis of vowel and tonal patterns in Chinese names across generations\n※NGAI, C.

      "contents": "\nIcoLL2026 is the joint conference of the 4th Iconicity Seminar (IcoSem) and the 15th International Symposium on Iconicity in Language and Literature (ILL). For the first time, the two international conferences on iconicity will take place together on 21-23 February 2026 hosted by the Nagoya University Graduate School of Humanities.\nInvited speakers\nNoburo Saji\nNoburo Saji (Waseda University)A Structural Perspective on Relational Similarity in Iconicity\n\nSee abstract\nThis presentation explores the potential of a structural approach to account for the motivation behind iconicity. Previous studies on iconicity have identified two major types of similarity: direct (perceptual) similarity and relational similarity (Dingemanse, 2011; Iida & Akita, 2024). Direct similarity refers to similarities between distinct entities based on shared features along specific dimensions (e.g., shape or sound). In contrast, relational similarity involves the structural alignment between the relationships among elements (e.g., shape-shape-relationships and sound-sound relationships). Researchers have noted that cross-modal iconicity must be understood from the perspective of relational similarity (Ahlner & Zlatev, 2011; Marks, 1989). While the psychological basis of relational similarity has been extensively studied, its application to iconicity research remains underdeveloped.　In this context, the present study draws attention to a structural approach, which has recently gained prominence in consciousness research. This approach investigates properties of unobservable phenomena—such as subjective experience—by analyzing the relational structure among surrounding elements, rather than attempting to access the target phenomenon directly (e.g., Kawakita et al., 2024). Using examples of cross-modal iconicity, this presentation examines how structural consistency across modalities can be evaluated, and discusses the implications of this approach for understanding the relational foundations of iconic mappings.\n\nAhlner, F., & Zlatev, J.

Iconicity, not limited to sound symbolism, tells children that linguistic forms are paired with meanings, and they expand and adjust their linguistic knowledge through an abductive reasoning. This self-driven developmental cycle may make humans different from other species.\n\nImai, Mutsumi, and Sotaro Kita. “The sound symbolism bootstrapping hypothesis for language acquisition and language evolution.” Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological sciences 369.1651 (2014): 20130298.\n\nPamela Perniss\nPamela Perniss (University of Cologne)TBA\nNeil Cohn\nNeil Cohn (Tilburg University)Iconicity and visual languages in a multimodal language faculty (Note: Changed to virtual presentation)\n\nSee abstract\nFor the past century, language has been considered as an amodal and arbitrary system that is mutable across different modalities. Yet, this view is confounded by multimodality (speech-gesture, text-images) and the full range of signification displayed by communicative systems (iconicity, indexicality, and symbolicity). Here, I first present a model of a multimodal language faculty which intrinsically maintains the vocal, bodily, and graphic modalities in parallel, and inherently embeds Peircean semiotics into its architecture. I will then show how this model not only enables a proliferation of signification in both the vocal and bodily modalities, but also specifies how linguistic structures emerge in pictorial systems, particularly in the rich conventionalization of visual languages of graphic systems across the world. Altogether, this approach heralds a re-understanding of what language is and the basic assumptions held about its properties.\nCall for papers\nTheme: Variations and Dynamics in Iconicity\nWe invite abstracts of any academic work on iconicity, the resemblance between form and meaning, in language or literature. We particularly invite contributions that explore the multifaceted nature of iconicity, encompassing its variations and dynamics across different conceptual domains, languages, cultures, and developmental stages. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:\nIconicity in the speech signal (sound symbolism, phonaesthemes, ideophones)\nIconicity in grammar and text\nIconicity in literature\nIconicity in sign languages\nIconicity in gestures\nIconicity in pictures and other visual media\nIconicity in music\nIconicity in narration\nIconicity in imagination (mental imagery)\nIconicity across sensory modalities (multimodality and cross-modality)\nIconicity in language evolution\nIconicity in child development\nIconicity among different forms of intelligence (animals, humans, AI, etc.)\nThe call for papers is now closed.\nAfter the conference, the presenters will be invited to submit a post-conference proceedings paper to the Iconicity in Language and Literature series (John Benjamins).\nProgram\nProvisional program (as of 8 Oct 2025) (pdf)\n\nDay\nTime\nSchedule\nRoom 1\nRoom 2\nRoom 3\nRoom 4\n1\n9:30-9:55\nOpening remarks (Hinano Iida)\n\n\n\n\n1\n10:00-11:00\nPlenary talk: A Structural Perspective on Relational Similarity in Iconicity (Noburo Saji)\n\n\n\n\n1\n11:05-11:20\nCoffee break\n\n\n\n\n1\n11:20-11:50\nOral presentations\n[Ideophones] Behavior mirrored in the brain: An fNIRS study of Chinese ideophone modality exclusivity (Van Hoey, Thomas; Yu, Xiaoyu; Zhang, Shuhao; Do, Youngah; Dewey, Dan)\n[Lexicon] Iconicity Norms for 6,000+ Brazilian Portuguese Words (Godoy, Mahayana C.)\n[Literature] Iconicity in the writer’s archive (Karpowicz, Agniezka)\n[Visual] From Page to Stage: Iconicity of Emotion Across Verbal and Visual-Kinesthetic Modes (Kostetskaya, Anastasia)\n1\n11:55-12:25\nOral presentations\n[Ideophones] Ideophonic language background does not aid in the comprehension of foreign ideophones (Herget, Marta; Neequaye, Josiah Nii Ashie; Tsang, Vanessa Wing Yan)\n[Lexicon] Symmetries and Parallels in English and Russian Phonaesthemes (Shamina, Elina)\n[Literature] Variations and Dynamics in Iconicity: A Study of Symbolic Liberation in Sree Narayana Guru’s Daiva Dasakam (Cherucodu, Rakesh)\n[Visual] Do visual signals really afford more iconicity than acoustic signals?
