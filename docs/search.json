Those wishing to present in a sign language are welcome do so, in which case English subtitles shall be provided.\nPlenary speaker: Neil Cohn (Tilburg University)\nMultimodality, iconcity, and visual lexicons\nThe traditional view has held that language is an amodal and arbitrary system that is mutable across different modalities. Yet, recent work on expressions in the bodily and graphic modalities have complicated this view, especially in light of multimodal communication. Here, I present a model of a multimodal language faculty which intrinsically maintains components for the vocal, bodily, and graphic modalities. This model inherently allows for conventionalization of all types of signification, including iconicity. I will illustrate this further by showing the extensive standardized visual lexicons using linguistic structures in purely graphic systems across the world. Altogether, this heralds a re-understanding of what language is.\nProgram\nEach talk will be 20 minutes presentation and 10 minutes Q&A.\n※ = Presenter\n\nTitle\nAuthor\nTime (GMT)\nWelcome and self-introductions\nJOO, Ian\n07:00\nSound symbolism through the ages: a longitudinal analysis of vowel and tonal patterns in Chinese names across generations\n※NGAI, C.

      "contents": "\nIcoLL2026 is the joint conference of the 4th Iconicity Seminar (IcoSem) and the 15th International Symposium on Iconicity in Language and Literature (ILL). For the first time, the two international conferences on iconicity will take place together, on 21-23 February 2026 at Nagoya University (Nagoya, Japan).\nInvited speakers\nMutsumi Imai\nNoburo Saji\nPamela Perniss\nTBA\nCall for papers\nTheme: Variations and Dynamics in Iconicity\nWe invite abstracts of any academic work on iconicity, the resemblance between form and meaning, in language or literature. We particularly invite contributions that explore the multifaceted nature of iconicity, encompassing its variations and dynamics across different conceptual domains, languages, cultures, and developmental stages. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:\nIconicity in the speech signal (sound symbolism, phonaesthemes, ideophones)\nIconicity in grammar and text\nIconicity in literature\nIconicity in sign languages\nIconicity in gestures\nIconicity in pictures and other visual media\nIconicity in music\nIconicity in narration\nIconicity in imagination (mental imagery)\nIconicity across sensory modalities (multimodality and cross-modality)\nIconicity in language evolution\nIconicity in child development\nIconicity among different forms of intelligence (animals, humans, AI, etc.)\nPlease send a 2-page abstract (including everything) in the following format:\nA4 paper\n2.5cm margin\n12pt Times New Roman\nPlease submit your anonymous abstract via Easychair. Your abstract will then be reviewed by two anonymous reviewers.\nThe deadline is 31 August 2025, but we encourage each participant to submit as soon as you are ready to, as decisions will be communicated to you on a rolling basis within two weeks from your submission (and not necessarily after the deadline). This will allow you to plan your trip well in advance.\nEach submission will be allocated as either an oral presentation (20min talk + 10min Q&A) or a poster presentation, based on the review and the presenter’s preference. Only one abstract submission is permitted per each first author - there is no restriction on the number of abstracts as a non-first author.\nFormat of the conference\nIcoLL2026 is an in-person conference without virtual participation, although some virtual presentations may be permitted in exceptional cases.\nDue to the difficulty of finding an English-to-JSL interpreter with expertise in linguistics and literature, we will unfortunately not be able to provide interpretation in Japanese Sign Language. In order to increase accessibility, however, we will provide live caption in English via Microsoft Teams.\nParticipation fee\nThe participation fee is 7,000 yen for students and 13,000 yen for non-students, to be paid by cash on site.\nAbout Nagoya\nNagoya is a city located in central Japan, easily accessible from Tokyo or Osaka.\nThe nearest international airports are:\nChubu Centrair International Airport (Nagoya) - 1 hour to Nagoya University\nKansai International Airport (Osaka) - 3 hours\nHaneda Airport (Tokyo) - 3 hours\nNarita International Airport (Tokyo) - 4 hours\nThe attractions in Nagoya and nearby cities include:\nNagoya Castle\nHisaya-Odori Park\nPort of Nagoya Aquarium\nGhibli Park (in Nagakute)\nInuyama Castle (in Inuyama)\nWe plan to arrange a group tour to the Ghibli Park for the participants who are interested. Please let the organizers know well before the conference, as the park is very popular and the tickets typically need to be booked two months in advance.\nOrganizers\nHinano Iida\nIan Joo\nKimi Akita\nLinks\nJoin our Facebook group for iconicity\n\n\n\n",
