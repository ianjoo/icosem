Yet, recent work on expressions in the bodily and graphic modalities have complicated this view, especially in light of multimodal communication. Here, I present a model of a multimodal language faculty which intrinsically maintains components for the vocal, bodily, and graphic modalities. This model inherently allows for conventionalization of all types of signification, including iconicity. I will illustrate this further by showing the extensive standardized visual lexicons using linguistic structures in purely graphic systems across the world. Altogether, this heralds a re-understanding of what language is.\nProgram\nEach talk will be 20 minutes presentation and 10 minutes Q&A.\n※ = Presenter\n\nTitle\nAuthor\nTime (GMT)\nWelcome and self-introductions\nJOO, Ian\n07:00\nSound symbolism through the ages: a longitudinal analysis of vowel and tonal patterns in Chinese names across generations\n※NGAI, C.
